    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>J2ME and PHP are both powerful technologies used to develop applications for mobile devices and Web applications, respectively. In this article, you&rsquo;ll see how to make them work together by developing a simple and useful application that retrieves the latest news from the Web and displays that on a mobile device.</h3>

<p>The Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME) is targeted at cell phones, smart cards, pagers, and other consumer devices. J2ME technology consists of a virtual machine and a set of APIs suitable for tailored runtime environments for these devices. PHP, on the other hand, is a widely used server-based language to build Web applications. But these two radically different technologies work very well together. In this article you&rsquo;ll see how they can interact via HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol). Of course, this is not intended to be a thorough explanation of how HTTP worksâ€”you only need to know that HTTP is a request/response protocol. That simply means that the client application performs a request and the server application returns a response.</p>
