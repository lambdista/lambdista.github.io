    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Here are some funny jokes and aphorisms about computer programmers and programming in general:</h4>

<hr />

<p>A man is smoking a cigarette and blowing smoke rings into the air.  His girlfriend becomes irritated with the smoke and says, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see the warning on the cigarette pack?  Smoking is hazardous to your health!&#8221;To which the man replies, &#8220;I am a programmer.  We don&rsquo;t worry about warnings; we only worry about errors.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>A programmer is walking along a beach and finds a lamp.  He rubs the lamp, and a genie appears.  &ldquo;I am the most powerful genie in the world.  I can grant you any wish, but only one wish.&#8221;The programmer pulls out a map, points to it and says, &#8220;I&rsquo;d want peace in the Middle East.&#8221;The genie responds, &#8220;Gee, I don&rsquo;t know.  Those people have been fighting for millennia.  I can do just about anything, but this is likely beyond my limits.&#8221;The programmer then says, &#8220;Well, I am a programmer, and my programs have lots of users.  Please make all my users satisfied with my software and let them ask for sensible changes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At which point the genie responds, &ldquo;Um, let me see that map again.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>Two strings walk into a bar and sit down.The bartender says, &ldquo;So what will it be?&#8221;The first string says, &#8220;I think I&rsquo;ll have a beer quag fulk boorg jdk<sup>CjfdLk</sup> jk3s d#f67howe%^U r89nvy~~owmc63<sup>Dz</sup> x.xvcu&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please excuse my friend,&rdquo; the second string says, &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t null-terminated.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>Why computers are like men:1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.
2. They have a lot of data, but are still clueless.
3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they are the problem.
4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a better model.Why computers are like women:</p>

<ol>
<li>No one but the Creator understands their internal logic.</li>
<li>The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.</li>
<li>Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.</li>
<li>As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.</li>
</ol>


<hr />

<p>A programmer finds himself in front of a committee that decides whether he should go to Heaven or Hell.  The committee tells the programmer he has a say in the matter and asks him if he wants to see either Heaven or Hell before stating his preference.&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; the programmer replies.  &ldquo;I have a pretty good idea what Heaven is like, so let&rsquo;s see Hell.&rdquo;  So an angel takes the programmer to a sunny beach, full of beautiful women in skimpy bikinis playing volleyball, listening to music and having a great time.  &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; he exclaims, &ldquo;Hell looks great!  I&rsquo;ll take Hell!&#8221;Instantly the programmer finds himself in red-hot lava with demons tearing at his flesh.  &#8220;Where&rsquo;s the beach?  The music?  The women?&rdquo; he screams frantically to the angel.&ldquo;That was the demo,&rdquo; the angel replies as she vanishes.</p>

<hr />

<p>Software Development Cycles:1. Programmer produces code he believes is bug-free.
2. Product is tested. 20 bugs are found.
3. Programmer fixes 10 of the bugs and explains to the testing department that the other 10 aren&rsquo;t really bugs.
4. Testing department finds that five of the fixes didn&rsquo;t work and discovers 15 new bugs.
5. Repeat three times steps 3 and 4.
6. Due to marketing pressure and an extremely premature product announcement based on overly-optimistic programming schedule, the product is released.
7. Users find 137 new bugs.
8. Original programmer, having cashed his royalty check, is nowhere to be found.
9. Newly-assembled programming team fixes almost all of the 137 bugs, but introduce 456 new ones.
10. Original programmer sends underpaid testing department a postcard from Fiji. Entire testing department quits.
11. Company is bought in a hostile takeover by competitor using profits from their latest release, which had 783 bugs.
12. New CEO is brought in by board of directors. He hires a programmer to redo program from scratch.
13. Programmer produces code he believes is bug-freeâ€¦</p>

    <id>http://lambdista.github.io/blog/why-you-shouldnt-be-concerned-about-optimization</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you were at the university or in any programming course, you&ndash;like me&ndash;were probably thought of the importance of
optimization. In the real world though, you should strive for writing good code&ndash;possibly using bullet-proof
Design Patterns&ndash;and defer optimization until later. Actually, you should optimize your code only if, after testing,
you realize that optimization is strongly necessary. There are three aphorisms concerning optimization that you cannot
but know:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency (without necessarily achieving it) than for any other
single reason, including blind stupidity.<br />
<strong>William A. Wulf</strong></p></li>
<li><p>We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.<br />
<strong> Donald E. Knuth</strong></p></li>
<li><p>We follow two rules in the matter of optimization:
Rule 1 Don&rsquo;t do it.
Rule 2 (for experts only). Don&rsquo;t do it yet, that is, not until you have a perfectly clear and unoptimized solution.<br />
<strong> M. A. Jackson</strong></p></li>
</ol>


<p>Notice that these great computer scientists wrote these aphorisms when computers were much slower than today&rsquo;s!</p>
