      <description>NOT IN does not behave as you would expect when NULL values are involved. Suppose you have the following tables:
Now try the following query:
 SELECT * FROM table_a a WHERE a.cd_field NOT IN (SELECT b.cd_field FROM table_b b); Does the previous query return any row? The answer is NO it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, even if there is a value (2) in table_a.cd_field which is not present in table_b.cd_field.
I think this is because NOT IN internally uses the inequality operator.</description>
