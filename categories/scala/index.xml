      <description>Recently, Daniel Westheide wrote an interesting post about the abuse of the Option type in Scala. You can find it here. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree more with Daniel.
This short story is another example that demonstrates how using Option is not always the best option (pun intended).
I&amp;rsquo;m developing an advertising service for a customer using Scala. A simplified version of the Ad data structure is the following:
final case class Ad( headline: String, description1: String, description2: String ) At some point they told me we need to support, by adding the headline2 field, two types of ad: standard and expanded.</description>

      <description>Yesterday my mate asked me: &amp;ldquo;I have a List[String] and a Map[String, Int] and I want a List[Int] where its values are those of the Map whose keys match the List[String] elements, maintaining the order. Should I use pattern matching?&amp;ldquo;. I know, the sentence is a bit convoluted but the code will make it clear, hopefully. Anyway, I replied: &amp;ldquo;No, you don&amp;rsquo;t need pattern matching, you just need this&amp;rdquo;:</description>

      <description>For this post I&amp;rsquo;ll consider the following simple case class unless otherwise specified: case class Person(lastname: String, firstname: String, birthYear: Int)
In this post:
 Common knowledge about case classes Not so common knowledge about case classes Defining a case class using the curried form Defining a case class with a private constructor For the most curious ones Final Notes  
Common knowledge about case classes When you declare a case class the Scala compiler does the following for you:</description>

      <title>Scala self-recursive types</title>

      <description>One of the advantages of using a statically typed language is that you can use the type system to enforce some constraints. Scala provides self-recursive types, aka F-bounded polymorphic types that&amp;ndash;along with self types&amp;ndash;let you put powerful constraint to your type definitions.
Self-recursive type definition Terminology apart, let me show you one of the use cases where this could be useful. Consider the following example which does not use a self-recursive type:</description>

      <title>Scala DSL for currency-related operations</title>

      <description>A simple internal DSL in Scala for money-related operations Source code: Scala DSL for money-related operations
This Domain-Specific Language (DSL) lets you perform operations among different currencies, by transparently doing all internal conversions. The conversion map is injected implicitly by the client code.
Usage Example Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple usage example:
import com.lambdista.money._ import com.lambdista.money.Currency._ object Main { def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = { val conversion: Conversion = Map( (GBP, EUR) -&amp;gt; 1.</description>
